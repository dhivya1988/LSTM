## LSTM

Introduction

Time series forecasting is done using a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM).
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to perform time series forecasting.
By leveraging the power of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies, the model can accurately predict future values in a given time series dataset. This approach is particularly effective for complex, sequential data where traditional forecasting methods fall short.
